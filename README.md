# Hey Guys 👋, My name is Marion Mcvay

🖥️ Driven to be a SOC Analyst

Welcome to my Github! I'm currently working Full-time as I build a foundation around Cybersecurity through labs, certifications, and hands-on projects.
My goals are somewhat simple and making them happen is something I look forward to!

👉 **Defend systems. Detect threats. Stay ahead of adversaries.**

## 🧭 My Journey  
- 📍 Started working around with Computers/Technology at the age of 7 years old gaining experience in troubleshooting and monitoring over the years through trial and tribulations.  
- 📚 Earned the **CompTIA Security+** certification to sharpen my cybersecurity skills. Currently pursuing **CySa+** and **AZ-900**
- 🛠️ Building homelabs featuring **SIEMs, IDS/IPS, malware detection & analysis, and cloud security tools**.  
- 🎯 Goal: Transition into a **SOC Analyst / Cybersecurity Analyst role** and grow toward Cloud Security/Architechture later on.
